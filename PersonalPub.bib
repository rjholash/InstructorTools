abstract = {Exergames or active video games are video games with interfaces that require active involvement and the exertion of physical force by participants. These exergames are designed to track body motion and provide both fun and exercise for game players. Numerous video game console companies have designed exergaming interfaces that are becoming very popular. This paper examines the nature of the interfaces and explores the possibility of using these interfaces for rehabilitation programs and research. While many systems exist, this paper will focus on three major players: Sony PlayStation Move, Nintendo Wii, and Microsoft Xbox 360 Kinect. Comparisons include the technical specifications, the motion sensed by each interface, and the motion required in each therapeutic activity type. Discussion addresses the research implications of using these tools.},

@article{MacIntosh2012,
abstract = {ATP provides the energy in our muscles to generate force, through its use by myosin ATPases, and helps to terminate contraction by pumping Ca(2+) back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, achieved by Ca(2+) ATPase. The capacity to use ATP through these mechanisms is sufficiently high enough so that muscles could quickly deplete ATP. However, this potentially catastrophic depletion is avoided. It has been proposed that ATP is preserved not only by the control of metabolic pathways providing ATP but also by the regulation of the processes that use ATP. Considering that contraction (i.e. myosin ATPase activity) is triggered by release of Ca(2+), the use of ATP can be attenuated by decreasing Ca(2+) release within each cell. A lower level of Ca(2+) release can be accomplished by control of membrane potential and by direct regulation of the ryanodine receptor (RyR, the Ca(2+) release channel in the terminal cisternae). These highly redundant control mechanisms provide an effective means by which ATP can be preserved at the cellular level, avoiding metabolic catastrophe. This Commentary will review some of the known mechanisms by which this regulation of Ca(2+) release and contractile response is achieved, demonstrating that skeletal muscle fatigue is a consequence of attenuation of contractile activation; a process that allows avoidance of metabolic catastrophe.},
