For assignments I will use the following highlighing convention.
<ul>
    <li><span style= "background-color: aquamarine">Green = great statement, agreed, good point, etc.</span>.</li>
    <li><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.3);">Yellow = mostly correct, but there are questions</span></li>
    <li><span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3);">Blue = grammatical issues</span></li>
    <li><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3);">Red = problematic statement, incorrect</span></li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
    <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3);">Resistance training is a proven method for hypertrophic development,</span> stimulating muscle growth through progressive overload. <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.3);">Is it really all about lifting heavier weights over time?</span> <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3);">There is, however, a belief that muscular training, or high repetition workouts, can also contribute to hypertrophy.</span> <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3);">Though some argue that only high-intensity, low-repetition workouts lead to muscle growth.</span>
